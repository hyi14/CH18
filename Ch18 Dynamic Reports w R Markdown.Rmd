```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Printing messages
```{r stored_print_example, echo = FALSE}
msg <- "**Hello world**"
```

Below is the message to see:

`r msg`

## Creating lists with vectors
```{r pasted_list_example, echo = FALSE}
# Create a vector of animals
animals <- c("Lions", "Tigers", "Bears", "Oh mys")

# Paste `-` in front of each animal and join the items together with
# newlines between
markdown_list <- paste("-", animals, collapse = "\n")
```

`r markdown_list`

## Rendering Tables (further customization w kableExtra)
```{r kable_example, echo = FALSE}
library("knitr")

# Make a data frame
letters <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
numbers <- 1:4
df <- data.frame(letters = letters, numbers = numbers)

# "Return" the table to render it
kable(df)
```

## Rendering Plots
```{r plot_example, echo = FALSE}
library("ggplot2") 

# Plot of college education vs. poverty rates in the Midwest
ggplot (data = midwest) +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(x = percollege, y = percadultpoverty, color = state)
  ) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set3")
```
